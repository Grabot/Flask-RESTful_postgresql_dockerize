# Flask-RESTful_postgresql_dockerize
A skeleton framework for creating a Flask REST API in docker with a postgresql database also in docker.
## What does it do?
- You can add objects to the database
  - Go to http://localhost:5000/add/ᐸnameᐳ the add an object with the given name
- You can view all objects in the database
  - Go to http://localhost:5000/all to view all the objects currently in the database
## That's it?
Yes, but this should give a clear idea on how it works and how to expand it! You can easily add more tables to the database and write new endpoints to fit your own REST api needs.
